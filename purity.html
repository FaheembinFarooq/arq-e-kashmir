  <h2>Purity & Testing</h2>

  <p>
    Honey is commonly adulterated using sugar syrups and heat processing.
    Visual appearance and taste are not reliable proof of purity.
  </p>

  <p>
    We follow a batch-based approach and plan to publish lab reports
    once testing is completed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Until reports are available, we clearly state limitations instead
    of making claims.
